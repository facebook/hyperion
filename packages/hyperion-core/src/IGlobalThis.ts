 * Usually in test environment, this module may be initialized multiple times.
 * But since it updates the global primodials, we should be careful to not redo
 * all the interception again. Specially since interceptMethod will pickup the
 * right (original) set of interceptors, we don't want to have a different ShadowPrototype
 * 
 * Also, in hyperion-dom, we do have interception of Window which is the globalThis of the browsers
 * That module will need to set the parent of the shadow prototype and register a few more information
 * To ensure that no one is really using the internal hooks of the ShadowPrototype for tracking object interception
 * the following IGlobalThisPrototype is kept local to this module and not exported. As of now all usecases of the
 * hyperion is in browser, if/when we support nodejs, there should be a similar mechanism for handling that environments
 * globalThis.
 * For this particular case, we are ok if the ShadowPrototype is not used.
