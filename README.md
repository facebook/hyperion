# hyperion

Hyperion is an open-source software project being developed to enhance the observability
and control inside of JavaScript applications, via virtualizing browers APIs.
Through the use of Hyperion, JavaScript developers can use and manipulate the behavior of 
JavaScript objects, creating a virtualized development environment. 

# Key Features

Brower API Virtualization: By using brower API's, Hyperion can create a virtualized development environment
that developers can control and change. This can help in the processes of testing and debugging software.

Observability: In Hyperion, there is automatic monitoring of JavaScript objects and classes. 
This aims to help developers understand the behavior of the project implementations, without having to
manually testing and seeing output. 

# How it Works

Hyperion works by integrating into JavaScript environment of a web application. It then proceeds to intercept the 
calls to the browser API, and changes them to its own implementations. This change in API calls, helps it monitor 
the process between the user and application, which then is used to provide insights into performance, behaviors, and 
security to the developers. The ability to change the API calls can be manipulated to test for how an application handles 
different input/error scnearios. 

# Use Cases

Testing and Debugging: Hyperion can be used to easily create various scenarios through modifying 
the API response behavior. Through these different scenarios, developers have the ability to 
test their code for unique edge cases or for specific inputs.

Performance Checking: The automatic monitoring of JavaScript classes and objects, can help 
provide crucial information on the performace of broswer API's and potential performance issues 
of the relevent application being developed. 

Security: Through the process of intercepting and breaking down API calls, Hyperion can 
help find unknown security vulnerabilities.
